The PBR movesets on TwitchPlaysPokemon are now public and accepting community contributions! 

Knowledge of YAML syntax, as well as Git and GitHub knowledge, helps, but is not at all required.

## The basics

### YAML set format

You can look at just about any set on this repo to see how to format a YAML Pokemon set. It's also briefly described in README.md.

### Pull requests

To propose a change, go to the file you want to change and click the pencil to edit it. 
Make your changes, add a commit message and click "Propose File Change".
This will create a *fork* for you; a copy of the repository that you can edit. 
You will then be prompted to make a *pull request*, a request for us to add your changes. Give it a meaningful title and body.
If you make mistakes we can always tell you how to fix them, but it is much easier if you turn "Allow edits from maintainers" on.
To make more changes in the same pull request, go to your fork (it will be at github.com/YourUsername/pbr-movesets),
switch to the branch that GitHub created (it will be something like patch-1), then navigate to files and edit them as before.

Of course, if you know how Git works, you can use that.

### What can I help with?

Our [Issues](https://github.com/TwitchPlaysPokemon/pbr-movesets/issues) page contains specific major goals we would like to reach.
Look here if you want to know what you can help with.
If you can't make a pull request to fix something small, don't use Issues; if you want to bring it to our attention, message a
moveset team member such as mathfreak231.
