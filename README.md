## What are the .YAML Files?
The .YAML files within this repository are all to help inject Pokemon within Twitch Plays Pokemon, Battle Revolution.

A blank Pokemon .YAML file will generally look like this (may vary depending on meta/tags):
```
species:
setname:
tags: []
item: []
ability: []
moves:
    - []
    - []
    - []
    - []
combinations:
    - []
separations:
    - []
gender: [m, f]
happiness: 255
biddable: True
rarity: 1.0
ball: []
nature:
ivs: {hp: , atk: , def: , spA: , spD: , spe: }
evs: {hp: , atk: , def: , spA: , spD: , spe: }
```
